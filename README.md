# AirBend :cyclone:

A pipeline for processing air pollution data. An excuse to upskill in [Databend](https://www.databend.com/) and [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core).

## Why Databend and not [snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/)

Databend is an open-source alternative to [snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) - the upside being that this pipeline will continue to function long after my free snowflake credits expire. It also allows me to peer into the inner workings of the database.
AirBend runs on local self-hosted instance of Databend.
